class PropertyFunction(ComponentFunction):
	"""
	Base class for functions that MapComponents will call on load to determine object property values.
		These are properties that vary by instance of any object, but may be checked by other functions,
		for example while determining placement
	
	Children of this class should implement execute (and, optionally, additional helper functions)
		This is the function that's called by MapComponents for each dynamic property in the object's property list

	Strictly speaking, SelectionProperties could be implemented as PropertyFunctions
		But for now, they're their own, very-similar thing, as they differ just enough to be worth having their own classes

	TODO: Decide if these should just be functions instead
		As classes, they support inheritance, which might be nice

	TODO: Decide if these should be read-only and nullipotent
		For now they're not - Notably, FindAndAssociateNetworkByName is the current method of adding to MapNetworks
		But these types of functions could be moved into universal triggered functions instead
